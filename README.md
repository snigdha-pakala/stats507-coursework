# stats507-coursework

STATS 507 at the University of Michigan is designed to help students familiarize themselves with the programming language Python, as well as learn how to utilize many computing stacks that Python offers. The purpose of this repository is to organize all of my assignments for this course in one place. Additionally, using GitHub will allow me to push smaller changes to my final project so I can keep my progress and changes organized and go back to a previous version if need be.
